Simon King (6):
      Upstream sources: MeatAxe 2.4.24
      Use the MtxLibDir directory to store library files, and other IO fixes
      Implement and use Strassen-Winograd multiplication
      Some performance improvements
      Propagating errors rather than crashing
      Use autotools, build shared library -> SharedMeatAxe 1.0
