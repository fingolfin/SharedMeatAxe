Description</h2>
<p>This program calculates the irreducible constituents of a given matrix representation. The representing matrices of the generators are read from input files, see "input Files" above. Unless a different number of generators has been specified with -g, two generators are expected. However, if the "-i" option is used, and the file <em>Name.cfinfo</em> exists, <b>chop</b> takes the number of generators from this file and ignores the "-g" option.</p>
<p>For each composition factor <b>chop</b> writes the action of the generators to <em>CFName.1</em>, <em>CFName.2</em>, ... <em>CFName</em> is the name of the composition factor, which is constructed by appending the dimension and a letter to the module name. For example, "X10a.1" is the action of the first generator on the first composition factor of dimension 10 of the module X. If a second, inequivalent composition factor of dimension 10 was found, it would be named `X10b' and so on. <b>chop</b> also creates the file <em>Name.cfinfo'</em> containing a list of all composition factors. This file is used by subsequent programs such as <a class="el" href="prog_pwkond.html">pwkond</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="impl"></a>
Implementation Details</h2>
<p><b>chop</b> repeatedly splits a module into submodule and quotient until it arrives at the irreducible constituents. Thus, it finds a composition series. The program assumes that the algebra generated by the input matrices contains the unit matrix.</p>
<p>In order to split a given module or to prove its irreducibility the algorithm needs an element of the algebra with a non-trivial but low-dimensional kernel. Such elements are searched by taking linear combinations of certain products of the generators ("words"). See the description of the <a class="el" href="prog_zmw.html">zmw</a> program for more details on the word generator. By default, <b>chop</b> tries all words in the order defined by the word generator. The "-s" option may be used to make <b>chop</b> start with a word different from 1.</p>
<p>For each word A generated in this way, the program calculates its characteristic polynomial and examines the irreducible factors. If p(x) is an irreducible factor, p(A) has a non-trivial kernel. Then, one vector of the kernel is chosen and the smallest submodule containing this vector is calculated. If the vector spans a proper submodule, the action of the generators on this submodule as well as on the quotient are calculated and the same procedure is applied recursively to both submodule and quotient.</p>
<p>To avoid expensive matrix multiplications in the calculation of p(A), there is a limit on the degree of p(x). This limit can be set with the "-d" option and defaults to 5.</p>
<p>If a module cannot be split by the program, it may be irreducible. In order to prove this, <b>chop</b> uses Norton's criterion. This requires, however, to find an algebra element with a small kernel, because up to scalar multiples each vector in the kernel must be examined to see whether it spins up to the whole module. For this reason a "nullity
threshold" m is maintained by the program. Initially, m is set to 3 or to the value given in the "-n" option. Each algebra element that has a nullity less then or equal to m is used for the Norton test.</p>
<p>In some cases the algorithm described is not able to split the module although it is reducible. These exceptional cases are treated with an alternative strategy described in <a class="el" href="pg_bib.html#LI98">[LI98]</a>.</p>
<p>Algebra elements with trivial kernel are useless for the algorithm, so an attempt is made to avoid unnecessary computation of such elements. Once an element is known to have a trivial kernel on a given module M, the program will mark it as invertible and ignore it for all constituents of M.</p>
<p>If a constituent is irreducible but not absolutely irreducible, the nullity of any element in the algebra will be a multiple of [E:F], where F is the ground field and E the splitting field. This situation is recognized by calculating the greatest common divisor d of all nullities which occur during the search. In order to prove that the splitting field degree is equal to <em>d</em>, the following method is used: Take a word with nullity <em>d</em> and two vectors v1, v2 in its null-space. Use these vectors as seeds for a standard basis algorithm. If the resulting representations are different, [E:F] is less than <em>d</em>, and the word is discarded. Otherwise, the linear map which transforms one standard basis into the other is an endomorphism <em>e</em> of the module. If v1, under the action of e, spins up to the whole null space, then [E:F]=<em>d</em>. Otherwise, take a third vector not in the span and repeat the procedure above. Again, this yields an endomorphism, or it turns out that [E:F]&lt;<em>d</em>. These steps are repeated until a word with nullity [E:F] is found. </p>
